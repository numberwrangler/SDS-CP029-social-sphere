- `addicted_score_regressor.joblib` - Regression model for addiction scores
- `addicted_score_scaler.joblib` - Feature scaler for regression model
- `clustering_model.joblib` - K-means clustering model
- `clustering_scaler.joblib` - Feature scaler for clustering
- `cluster_labels.joblib` - Cluster labels and descriptions

### MLflow Models
- `models:/conflicts_classifier/latest` - MLflow registered conflicts model
- `models:/addicted_score_regressor/latest` - MLflow registered regression model

### Data Files (saved to `../data/`)
- `cleaned_data.csv` - Preprocessed dataset
- `clustered_data.csv` - Dataset with cluster assignments

## üîß Key Features

## üéØ Use Cases

These notebooks support the Social Sphere Gradio application by providing:
1. **Predictive Models**: For real-time user predictions
2. **Behavioral Insights**: For understanding user patterns
3. **Risk Assessment**: For identifying high-risk users
4. **Recommendations**: For personalized advice
5. **MLflow Integration**: For model versioning and deployment

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Install all required packages from `requirements.txt`
2. **Data Path Issues**: Ensure data files are in the correct location
3. **Memory Issues**: Consider reducing dataset size for large files
4. **Model Loading Errors**: Check that all model files are properly saved
5. **MLflow Connection**: Ensure MLflow server is running for model registry

### Performance Tips
